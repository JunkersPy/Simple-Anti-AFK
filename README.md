This project provides an anti-AFK (Away From Keyboard) tool that prevents inactivity timeouts in applications or games by simulating user actions using the pyautogui and keyboard libraries.

Many online platforms, games, and applications have inactivity detectors that log out or penalize users if they remain inactive for a certain period. This tool helps bypass such detectors by simulating mouse movements and clicks when specific keys are pressed.

Press NUMPAD6 to simulate a mouse click at the center of the screen.
Press NUMPAD3 to simulate mouse clicks 3 pixels to the left and right of the center of the screen.

How to Use

Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
pip install pyautogui keyboard

Run the script:
python anti_afk_tool.py
